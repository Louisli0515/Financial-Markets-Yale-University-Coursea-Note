My own note about Financial Market module at Yale University

## Introduction
Financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society, directing resources across space and time to their best uses, supporting and incentivizing people in their productive venture, and managing the economic risks they take on.

### Good and Evil

Finance is a Technology, for Good or Evil.

* All technologies can be used or misued.
* Developing world is more interested in finance technology than in our paltry foreign aid or empty sympathies
* The most successful people in finance end their lives as philanthropists.
